# Rectangle-lightweight-block-cipher

## Description
The RECTANGLE block cipher is a type of lightweight block ciphers that adopts the SP-network structure (substitution permutation network structure). Where the S-layer (substitution) consists of 16 (4*4) S-boxes in parallel. And the P-layer (permutation) is composed of 3 rotations. The RECTANGLE cipher is an iterated block cipher which is of 64 bits length and (80 or 128) bits key length that pass by three main processes which are: (Representing the cipher state and the subkey state, the round transformation and the key schedule).

## How to run the code
1) Install nodeJs runtime
2) Open the terminal in the directory where you downloaded rectangle.js
3) type the command ```node rectangle```
